# Coin-Collection
Several coins are placed in cells of an n by m board, no more than one coin per cell. A robot, located in the upper left cell of the board, needs to collect as many of the coins as possible and bring them to the bottom right cell.

On each step, the robot can move either one cell to the right or one cell down from its current
location. When the robot visits a cell with a coin, it always picks up that coin.


# Shortest Path
A social network consisting of sixteen gossipers is shown in Figure 1. Each circle represents a gossiper and each directed edge represents a path to another gossiper. Two gossipers are said to be adjacent if there is an edge connecting them. Associated with each edge is a time delay which is the amount of time in minutes for a rumor to be sent over that edge. Each gossiper transmits its rumor using the broadcast approach, meaning that it may simultaneously transmit a rumor over all its edges it is connected to. 

For example, gosspier 1 may simultaneously transmit a message to gossipers 2; 3; 4, and 5. (The delay
is due to when adjacent gossipers check their Twitter feed!)

Assume that gossiper 1 wishes to broadcast a rumor to every other gossiper in the network. Gossiper 1 will simultaneously transmit the rumor to each of its adjacent gossipers. In turn, when an adjacent gossiper receives the rumor, that gossiper will simultaneously transmit (i.e. forward) the rumor along all of its outgoing edges.
